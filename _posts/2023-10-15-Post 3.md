## 1. Executive Summary
**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 7.5 (High) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H  
**CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 8.7 (High) — CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:N/VI:N/VA:H  

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-63363](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-63363)

**ATTENTION:** Exploitable by any attacker within wireless range / no authentication required  
**Vendor:** Waveshare Electronics  
**Equipment:** Waveshare RS232/485 TO WIFI ETH (B) Serial-to-Ethernet/Wi-Fi Gateway  
**Vulnerability:** Missing IEEE 802.11w Management Frame Protection (MFP), enabling forged deauthentication and disassociation attacks

The Waveshare RS232/485 TO WIFI ETH (B) device does not implement IEEE 802.11w Management Frame Protection. As a result, the device accepts unauthenticated deauthentication and disassociation frames, allowing attackers within Wi-Fi range to disconnect legitimate clients and cause sustained denial-of-service (DoS).


## 2. Risk Evaluation
This vulnerability is classified as **High** severity due to:

- No authentication required to exploit  
- Attack possible from any attacker within wireless proximity  
- Repeated deauth frames can fully disrupt the device’s wireless function  
- Disruption may sever serial-to-IP communication paths  
- In industrial automation or IIoT settings, DoS can interrupt telemetry, alarms, or PLC/RTU data flow  

Attacks are silent, continuous, and difficult to detect without wireless intrusion monitoring.


## 3. Technical Details

### 3.1 Affected Products
- **Waveshare RS232/485 TO WIFI ETH (B)**  
  - Firmware: **V3.1.1.0**  
  - Hardware: **4.3.2.1**  
  - Web UI: **V7.04T.07.002880.0301**

### 3.2 Vulnerability Description
The device does not support IEEE 802.11w MFP.  
As a result:

- Management frames (including deauth & disassoc) are **not authenticated**  
- Any attacker with a Wi-Fi interface in monitor/injection mode can craft forged frames  
- The device and clients accept these as legitimate  

Example attack pattern:

```
Deauthentication frame:
Source: spoofed AP MAC
Reason Code: 7 (Class 3 frame received from nonassociated station)
```

Attack tools such as *aireplay-ng*, *mdk4*, or *scapy* can repeatedly send forged frames, keeping clients disconnected indefinitely.

### 3.3 Attack Scenarios

#### Scenario 1 — Continuous DoS
An attacker runs a loop sending forged deauth frames, preventing all Wi-Fi clients from reconnecting.

#### Scenario 2 — Intermittent operational disruption
The attacker disrupts communications during critical automation workflows, such as PLC polling.

#### Scenario 3 — Combined with other vulnerabilities
If combined with the cleartext credential exposure (CVE-2025-63364), attackers can sniff admin logins while forcing reconnections.


## 4. Mitigations

### User Recommendations
- Prefer wired Ethernet for critical deployments.  
- Place device Wi-Fi on isolated or low-trust networks.  
- Deploy wireless IDS systems to detect abnormal deauth activity.  
- Follow CISA ICS hardening guidance:  
  https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-alerts/ics-alert-10-301-01  
- Limit RF exposure by lowering transmit power or relocating APs.  

### Vendor Recommendations
- Implement IEEE 802.11w MFP support.  
- Validate deauth and disassoc frames.  
- Add rate-limiting and anomaly detection for unprotected management frames.  
- Provide logging options for Wi-Fi security events.

## 6. Background
Waveshare’s RS232/485 gateway is widely deployed in:

- industrial automation networks  
- IIoT sensor and telemetry systems  
- building automation and access control  
- embedded development/test labs  

Reliable Wi-Fi is crucial in these environments; lack of MFP exposes them to trivial DoS.
