## **1. Executive Summary**

A vulnerability in the Waveshare RS232/485 TO WIFI ETH (B) gateway allows authentication bypass when the administrator username and password are configured as blank values, disabling authentication entirely and granting unrestricted administrative access.

- **CVE ID:** [CVE-2025-63362](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2025-63362)  
- **CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 9.8 (Critical) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  
- **CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 9.3 (Critical) — CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H  
- **Attention:** Exploitable remotely / no authentication required  
- **Vendor:** Waveshare Electronics  
- **Equipment:** Waveshare RS232/485 TO WIFI ETH (B)  
- **Vulnerability:** Authentication Bypass via Blank Administrator Credentials  
- **CSAF Document:** [**View CSAF**]({{ '/assets/CSAF/CSAF-CVE-2025-63362.json' | relative_url }})

## **2. Risk Evaluation**
The vulnerability presents severe risk because:

- Any remote attacker can obtain full administrative control with **no credentials**.
- Configuration tampering may disrupt serial routing and industrial communication workflows.
- Unauthorized users can modify key network and Wi-Fi settings, enabling deeper compromise.
- Operational visibility and safety may be affected in ICS/IIoT environments.

## **3. Technical Details**

### 3.1 Affected Products
- **Waveshare RS232/485 TO WIFI ETH (B)**
  - Firmware Version: **V3.1.1.0**
  - Hardware Version: **4.3.2.1**
  - Web Interface: **V7.04T.07.002880.0301**

### 3.2 Vulnerability Description
The endpoint `/EN/do_cmd.html` accepts blank administrator credential fields:

- `admuser` — administrator username  
- `SYSPS` — administrator password  

The device performs **no validation** to ensure the parameters are non-empty.

Example vulnerable request:
```
POST /EN/do_cmd.html
admuser=&SYSPS=
```

When both values are blank:

- The device **stores the empty credentials**.  
- The authentication routine treats empty strings as valid.  
- All authentication on web and Telnet interfaces becomes bypassed.

This creates a **universal access condition** for any remote attacker.

### 3.3 Attack Scenarios
- #### Scenario 1 — Remote unauthenticated takeover
An attacker sends a request setting blank credentials and then logs in without a password.

- #### Scenario 2 — Opportunistic exploitation
If a legitimate user misconfigures the device (leaving credentials blank), the attacker simply browses to the web UI and gains full access.

- #### Scenario 3 — Telnet control
Once bypassed, Telnet access becomes unrestricted if enabled, allowing manipulation of low-level device operations.

## **4. Mitigations**

### 4.1 User Recommendations
- Ensure administrator credentials are never blank
- Restrict management access via firewalls and VLAN segmentation
- Disable Telnet if not required
- Follow CISA ICS security guidance:

### 4.2 Vendor Recommendations
- Enforce mandatory non-empty credentials
- Block saving empty configuration values
- Implement password complexity requirements
