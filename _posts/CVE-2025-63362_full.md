# CVE-2025-63362 – Authentication Bypass via Blank Credentials

## 1. Executive Summary
**CVSS v3.1 Base Score:** 9.8 (Critical) — AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  
**CVSS v4.0 Base Score:** 9.3 (Critical) — CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:N/UI:N/VC:H/VI:H/VA:H  

**ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely / no authentication required  
**Vendor:** Waveshare Electronics  
**Equipment:** Waveshare RS232/485 TO WIFI ETH (B) Serial-to-Ethernet/Wi-Fi Gateway  
**Vulnerability:** Authentication Bypass via Blank Administrator Credentials

A vulnerability in the Waveshare RS232/485 TO WIFI ETH (B) device allows the administrator username and password to be set to blank values. When configured this way, the device disables authentication entirely, granting unrestricted administrative access to the web interface and Telnet service.

---

## 2. Risk Evaluation
This vulnerability presents severe risk because:

- Any remote attacker can obtain full administrative control with **no credentials**.
- Configuration tampering could disrupt serial-to-IP communication workflows.  
- Attackers may alter Wi-Fi parameters, routing behavior, baud rate settings, and serial mappings.
- Full compromise of downstream industrial devices (PLCs/RTUs/sensors) becomes possible.
- In ICS/IIoT deployments, authentication bypass can lead to loss of operational visibility or sabotage.

Given its remote and unauthenticated nature, this vulnerability is classified as **Critical**.

## 3. Technical Details

### 3.1 Affected Products
- **Waveshare RS232/485 TO WIFI ETH (B)**  
  - Firmware Version: **V3.1.1.0**  
  - Hardware Version: **4.3.2.1**  
  - Web Interface: **V7.04T.07.002880.0301**

### 3.2 Vulnerability Description
The endpoint `/EN/do_cmd.html` processes administrative configuration changes.  
It accepts two key authentication parameters:

- `admuser` — administrator username  
- `SYSPS` — administrator password  

The device performs **no validation** to ensure the parameters are non-empty.

Example vulnerable request:
```
POST /EN/do_cmd.html
admuser=&SYSPS=
```

When both values are blank:

- The device **stores the empty credentials**.  
- The authentication routine treats empty strings as valid.  
- All authentication on web and Telnet interfaces becomes bypassed.

This creates a **universal access condition** for any remote attacker.

### 3.3 Attack Scenarios

#### Scenario 1 — Remote unauthenticated takeover
An attacker sends a request setting blank credentials and then logs in without a password.

#### Scenario 2 — Opportunistic exploitation
If a legitimate user misconfigures the device (leaving credentials blank), the attacker simply browses to the web UI and gains full access.

#### Scenario 3 — Telnet control
Once bypassed, Telnet access becomes unrestricted if enabled, allowing manipulation of low-level device operations.

## 4. Mitigations

### User Recommendations
- Ensure administrator credentials are **never blank**.  
- Implement firewall restrictions to limit management interface exposure.  
- Disable Telnet wherever possible.  
- Deploy the device in isolated management VLANs.  
- Follow CISA ICS security recommendations:  
  https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-alerts/ics-alert-10-301-01

### Vendor Recommendations
- Enforce mandatory non-empty credentials.  
- Add server-side validation in `/EN/do_cmd.html`.  
- Provide password complexity enforcement options.  
- Prevent saving blank values at both UI and backend layers.
