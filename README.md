**OTSecVerse** 🌐

Welcome to **OTSecVerse** — a personal project dedicated to exploring the intersection of **Operational Technology (OT)** and **Cybersecurity**.  

This site serves as a **learning space and knowledge journal**, documenting **research, observations, and insights** from ongoing exploration into **industrial systems, ICS, and SCADA security**.


## What This Site Is About

**OTSecVerse** focuses on practical, research-oriented content aimed at understanding and improving security across industrial and critical infrastructure environments.  

Here you’ll find:
-  **Advisories and technical analyses**  
-  **Insights into OT/ICS protocols and architectures**  
-  **Discussions on security posture and resilience**  
-  **Reflections on cybersecurity learning and trends**

All content is **independent**, written from genuine curiosity and a passion for learning in the OT security domain.


## Philosophy

"*Understanding systems deeply is the foundation of securing them.*”

**OTSecVers* was created to share findings, methodologies, and lessons learned — always from a perspective of **responsible research, curiosity, and continuous learning**.

## Areas of Interest

- ICS/SCADA Security  
- Network and Protocol Research (Modbus, DNP3, OPC UA, EtherNet/IP)  
- Embedded Systems and Hardware Security
